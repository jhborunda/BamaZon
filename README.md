##In this activity I craeted an Amazon-Like storefront with the MySQL skill i have learned until now. 

##This app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's Inventory.

Challenge #1: Customer View -
* First I created a table in MySQL with 10 product items.
* Second created a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js.

Function of bamaZon:
APP is suppsoed to ask the customer the following:
* The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

See GIPHY below for app in action:
- Customer inputs more products than what is actually in stock:

See GIPHY below for app in action:
- Customer succesfully buys a kegerator:

As you can see, I'm able to get the customer to execute the purchase; however, app is having issues when it trys to update stock in MySQL.
